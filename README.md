# Into-to-ML

Major assigments were hands on practice. <br/>
**MajorHW1** - Data Exploration, Preparation and the kNN model. <br/>
**MajorHW2** - Algorithm Implementation and Basic Model Selection. Used three algorithms: k-NN, Decision Trees (with ID3), and Soft-SVM. <br/>
**MajorHW3** - Regression.  <br/> <br/>

Short assigments were a theoretical practice: <br/>
**ShortHW1** - Preparing for the course, basic libreries and probabilty background. <br/>
**ShortHW2** - Classification. Focused Decision Trees, Linear classification and kNN. <br/>
**ShortHW3** - SVM, Optimization, PAC learning and VC dimentions. <br/>
**ShortHW4** - â€“ Optimization, Regression, and Boosting. <br/> <br/>

The course has yet finished. This repo is still under changes and updates. <br/>
