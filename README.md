# Into-to-ML

Major assigments were hands on practice.
**MajorHW1** - Data Exploration, Preparation and the kNN model.
**MajorHW2** - Algorithm Implementation and Basic Model Selection. Used three algorithms: k-NN, Decision Trees (with ID3), and Soft-SVM.
**MajorHW3** - Regression. 

Short assigments were a theoretical practice:
**ShortHW1** - Preparing for the course, basic libreries and probabilty background.
**ShortHW2** - Classification. Focused Decision Trees, Linear classification and kNN.
**ShortHW3** - SVM, Optimization, PAC learning and VC dimentions.
**ShortHW4** - â€“ Optimization, Regression, and Boosting.

The course has yet finished. This repo is still under changes and updates.
